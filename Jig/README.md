## Note

The jig isn't part of the keyboard itself but is used to assemble the layers of acrylic sheets. Creating one is crucial because, without it, your sides will be misaligned. Apart from compromising the feel, fixing the micro switch and keycap becomes challenging.

Place the first layer in the jig, apply glue, then next layer, fix the micro switches in the slots, and apply glue for next layer, fix the last layer, push the keyboard out of the jig through the holes in the base of jig.

Fix key caps on the micro switch and the keyboard is ready. 

You can use different colors for different layers of the keyboard, try different themes!

You can engrave anything on the acrylic sheet; just provide an image to the vendor.
