## Note

Keycaps are designed to press fit onto the micro switch.

For those who are tweaking the keycap design, they may rotate on the switch if their height isn't adjusted properly. They should be high enough to allow a full click and a bit into the first layer to restrict rotation.

Sometimes, you might want to adjust dimensions based on the tolerance of the printer.
